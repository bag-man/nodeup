##NodeUP

This is a little project I am working on with [Jamie Knight](http://github.com/jamiek23) to make a website similar to isup.me, but with more awesome features!

It is far from finished so don't be too critical!

##TODO
* Try adding a trailing / at the end of a domain argument. I.e. itsback.at/domain.com/ We need to fix that...

* Clear interval for client when submitting new domain

* Validate URL input (At the moment I add http:// on the server side. Plus we should strip out just the domain and use that.)

* Pick favicon :P

* Clean up alert/redirect

* Testing shit way more thoroughly
