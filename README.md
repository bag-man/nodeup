##NodeUP

This is a little project I am working on with [Jamie Knight](http://github.com/jamiek23) to make a website similar to isup.me, but with more awesome features!

At the moment, we have finished the basic functionality of the site, and we are opening it up to the internet so that hopefully we can get some more varied testing done. 

The site is live at [itsback.at](http://itsback.at). Please remeber this site was built for learning, so if you see anything you shouldn't please give us a shout!


The project was built using NodeJS, Express and Socket.IO.
