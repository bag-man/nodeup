##NodeUP

This is a little project I am working on with [Jamie Knight](http://github.com/jamiek23) to make a website similar to isup.me, but with more awesome features!

It is far from finished so don't be too critical!

##TODO
* When multiple clients access the same domain the requests hang. So multiple clients isn't working

* Investigate if multiple alerts stack. So if a site is down and the user doesn't hit okay will they get spammed. 

* Add info/usage/contact etc..

* Testing shit way more thoroughly, perhaps create a node app to generate HTTP codes
